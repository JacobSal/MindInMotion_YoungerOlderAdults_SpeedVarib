02042025: fixed a bug that was removing much of the kinematic data across 30 subjects and was potentially corrupting other subject kinematic data. all data after this date should be goood according to validation figures.
02/06/2025: fixed another bug in the PSD generation (fixed baselines designated with "new") where some of the baselines were not being layered correctly and therefore multiple baselining procedures did not work.
