<h3 align="center">(Mind In Motion) Younger vs Older Adults Electrocortical Dynamics with Walking Speed Changes</h3>

  <p align="justify">
    Preferred and maximum walking speeds decline as we age and have been associated with worsening health. A body of evidence has shown biomechanical, sub-cortical, and some cortical contributions to slowing gait speed.  Additional studies observing older and younger adults’ whole brain dynamics during walking would provide insight into network wide contributions to slowing gait. We studied younger (N=31) and older adults (N=57) walking on a treadmill at different speeds (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0 m/s) while their electrocortical dynamics were recorded using high density electroencephalography EEG. We hypothesized  that sensorimotor and posterior parietal theta power would increase and beta power would decrease with increasing gait speed, consistent with previous studies of younger adults walking at different speeds. Additionally, we used a standardized test of physical function to group older adults. A Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)  categorized older adults into high (SPPB>=10) and low (SPPB<10) function groups.  Then we compared EEG power modulations across age and physical function. In agreement with our hypotheses, sensorimotor and posterior parietal theta power increased, and beta power decreased with increasing gait speed. Additionally, we observed differences in power modulations between younger and older adults in sensorimotor, posterior parietal, mid cingulate, left supplementary motor, and right temporal. Our results show that regulation of gait speed activates a network of brain areas that are thought to be involved in error detection and sensorimotor processing.   Further, there are differences in electrocortical contributions between younger and older adults while walking at different speeds, and mobility status may play a role in the degree of these contributions.
