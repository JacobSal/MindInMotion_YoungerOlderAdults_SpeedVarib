<h3 align="center">Interstride Variation in EEG Power Spectra of Younger and Older Adults Walking at a Range of Gait Speeds</h3>

  <p align="justify">
    Abstract—Aging alters both biomechanical and neural factors related to walking, leading to reductions in preferred gait speed with age. Biomechanical variability has been an area of great interest when studying walking in older adults. Neural variability has not been as well studied in this context. Electroencephalography (EEG) can measure brain activity during walking, allowing us to quantify interstride variability of electrocortical activity. We recruited younger and older adults to walk (0.25-1.0 m/s) while we measured EEG interstride variability in theta power and beta power. We hypothesized that theta and beta variability would decrease at faster walking speeds as most gait kinematic variables show decreased variability with speed. We also hypothesized that older adults would have more interstride variability compared to younger adults due to reduced gait automaticity. We focused on the sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortices for their roles in motor action and sensory processing. At faster walking speeds, interstride variability in theta power was lower than at slower speeds in posterior parietal cortex and beta power was lower in both sensorimotor and posterior parietal cortex.  Comparing younger and older adults, we found that older adults had steeper decreases in interstride variability. We also observed phasic alignment of electrocortical signals between gait cycles and found that walking faster increased electrocortical phase coherence. Comparing groups, we found that older higher functioning had greater phasic alignment between gait cycles in gamma (30-50 Hz) than younger adults in parietal cortex. These findings suggest that decreases in neural interstride variability occurs with faster gait speeds, and that older adults show less interstride variability in electrocortical activity than younger adults.
